                This is an application I developed in DirectX 11 as part of my Further Games & Graphics module during my
                second year of university. It is a graphical simulation of a boat on water, and is currently consisting
                of the graphical implementation, but next semester I will begin work on implementing physics. I have
                have been working on this project for the last 2 months.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Ambient, diffuse and specular lighting works and factors in directional/point light instances that can moved and altered, either via JSON or during runtime programmatically.</li>
                                <li>Textures (.dds) and meshes (.obj) can be loaded in and can vary by instance of game object</li>
                                <li>The skybox works and follows the camera, using a shader to calculate the gradient between the two shades of blue</li>
                                <li>I was able to implement terrain and use a pixel shader to lerp between colours to make it look more authentic</li>
                                <li>Water makes use of texture coordinate manipulation to create a tiled, swaying effect</li>
                                <li>Cameras work well in both first and third person, and fixed cameras work well</li>
                                <li>I managed to successfully learn HLSL in making this project</li>
                                <li>Game objects can make use of varying shaders to suit the specific object's needs</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The application does not currently support muiltiple levels</li>
                                <li>JSON can be read but not written, it must be edited from the file</li>
                                <li>Spotlights would have been a good addition for lighting</li>
                                <li>Terrain would have looked better if it used textures rather than solid colours, same for skybox</li>
                                <li>Cameras would have been better if they had collision so they cannot clip through terrain, this is planned for next semester when physics is done</li> 
                                <li>There is a red sphere that is meant to be used as a seamine in the next semester, an actual model would have looked nicer</li>
                                <li>If the boat swayed and moved up and down to communicate buoyancy, the simulation would be more complete, this will be done next semester</li>
                                <li>Collision between the boat and terrain would be good, will be added next semester</li>

                I developed this project for my Game Engines Creation module during my first year of university,
                programming it in C++ using the SDL library. The end result is a clone of both the original arcade Mario
                Bros
                game, and the original Super Mario Bros for the NES, combined into one game. I earned a grade of 97% on
                the assignment this project was developed for.

                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Problems Solved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To navigate my user interface widgets, I needed to implement buttons, so I made my own using
                        AABB collision
                        checks to check if a button is clicked, and using enums to tag buttons with certain purposes and
                        using switch statements to execute the correct response upon a button being clicked</li>
                    <li>SDL does not have functionality for text handling, so I implemented my own text that takes
                        strings and then makes them into a sequence of sprites from a spritesheet and renders them
                        sequentially</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I used a spritesheet from the source material, but perhaps if the spritesheet were in ASCII
                            order the implementation would be more elegant</li>
                        <li>Because Super Mario Bros had limited characters, I wasn't able to implement a wide variety
                            of characters and had to make do with what was available</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>To save on memory and to prevent unexpected behaviour, instead of using the game object classes
                        used for the actual live gameplay as
                        placeable tiles in the level editor, I had to make a level editor tile for each game object
                        class that is converted
                        into a format when the level is saved, that represents the live tiles when the actual level is
                        loaded and played</li>
                    <li>To implement blocking collision, I implemented a system into movement that performed checks to
                        see if a character's movement would make them overlap (determined with AABB) with something that
                        blocks, and if it does, the movement is cancelled</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because all characters (Koopas, Mario, Luigi, coins in Mario Bros) are subclasses of the
                            character baseclass that the movement function is implemented into, this blocking collision
                            is implemented elegantly into all game objects that move</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>I made use of a sorting algorithm, both for adding Z sorting to ensure objects correctly render
                        in the right order, taking advantage of the fact that whatever is rendered last in SDL will show
                        at the front of the view</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also used a sorting algorithm to make it so that high scores are displayed from highest to
                            lowest, with anything out of the top being culled</li>
                        <li>The algorithm I used was bubblesort</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>To make using the level editor a little easier and user-friendly, I added a grid that can be
                        toggled with the G key that toggles a grid that overlays over the screen so the user knows
                        exactly which tile they're placing their object into when designing levels</li>

                                <li>Making the level editor, main menu and high score tables taught me a lot about
                                    developing UI components from scratch</li>
                                <li>My level editor was robust enough to enable me to accurately recreate the levels
                                    from
                                    the source material</li>
                                <li>Through developing this project I was able to attain a deep understanding of how to
                                    use
                                    the SDL library</li>
                                <li>In developing the engine for this project I was able to build on my knowledge of OOP
                                    to
                                    organize my functionality in a much more clean fashion</li>
                                <li>My knowledge of file I/O was boosted significantly in implementing saving and

                                    for high scores and levels</li>
                                <li>My system for managing and switching between levels ended up working really well
                                </li>
                                <li>Multiple player characters for two player was easy to implement because of good
                                    design

                                    <li>With more time, I would have researched a more robust method of collision

                                    <li>The current system is not very modular and adding new buttons can be a very
                                        complicated task</li>
                                    <li>Performing AABB checks on every button onscreen to see if it collides with the

                Tilewar was a project I developed at college during my studies in game design for a specialist project,
                when I specialized in engine development and programming. It is a turn based strategy game made in UE4
                primarily with the C++ API it provides, and features a custom implementation of the A* pathfinding
                algorithm.

                <ul>
                    <li>A custom tile grid system</li>
                    <li>A custom implementation of A* that is compatible with my tile system</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Makes use of UE4's binary heap data structure</li>
                        <li>Uses euclidean distance and tiebreaker heuristics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Multiple levels</li>
                    <li>Basic graphics settings</li>
                    <li>AI that reacts to conditions in the game (defensive when hurt, otherwise on the offensive
                        against
                        the player)</li>
                    <li>Multiple player characters that the player can switch between and control if they have usable
                        movement points in the turn</li>
                    <li>Win and lose conditions based on if the player kills all the enemies or the enemies kill all
                        player
                        characters</li>

                                <li>In developing this project I learned how to use C++ with Unreal Engine 4 and
                                    developed
                                    my skills in working with existing complex codebases</li>
                                <li>I successfully taught myself the A* pathfinding algorithm and managed to implement
                                    it
                                    into UE4 whilst adapting to and working with the constraints and pre-existing
                                    functionality of the engine</li>
                                <li>I managed to get the AI working well and in a way that feels challenging and
                                    interesting
                                    to play against</li>

                                <li>There are some minor bugs with turn order that could be fixed if I had more time to
                                    work
                                    on the project</li>
                                <li>Visuals could do with some work</li>
                                <li>The game would perhaps be more interesting if instead of using a tile based system
                                    it
                                    instead was more freeform with some terrain that takes longer to traverse than other
                                    terrain</li>
                                <li>My calculations that work out damage dealt by attacks that factor in the attack and
                                    defense of both the attacker and defender could have been more thought out</li>
