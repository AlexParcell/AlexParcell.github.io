            <h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold">About Me</h2>
            <p class="text-center">
                I am a programmer and game developer from the UK. I have been working in the games industry for 2 years, and studied game development for several years prior to entering the industry, first studying Computer Game Design at College and then Computer Game Programming at University.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                I decided from a young age that I was interested in making games. To me, games are a means to make people's lives better. They teach, they inform, they entertain, and they enable a greater understanding of the world, ourselves, and eachother. I am very influenced by Satoru Iwata's philosophies on games, especially the ideal that they should be universal, for everyone to enjoy. I am fuelled by a strong creative desire to assist the greater industry-wide effort to provide games for people to enjoy, and to enrich their lives through them.
            </p> 
            <p class="text-center">
                As a programmer, I find my ability to contribute towards the creation of games is best suited to solving difficult technical problems. I am very interested in fixing difficult bugs, implementing nuanced systems, and providing assistance to movements greater than myself to make ambitious and interesting things. My coding style is very simplicity-oriented. In my work, I aim to write simple, reusable, performant, expressive code that ticks all the boxes where possible. I see my code as my own personal brand, and take great pride in it.

                Although this project doesn't look or sound very good, the underlying functionality to me is very powerful. Embedded into an engine of my own creation made with the SDL2 Framework, with some assistance from ImGui for tooling, this demo shows off cats (chosen to evade the need for natural language processing) acting out a series of behaviours from a finite state machine, determined by an emotional state that is dynamically responsive to real time game events, augmented by a constant personality type. The models of personality and emotion utilize real-world models from the fields of psychology and cognitive science, namedly Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions for emotional states, and the Big Five OCEAN model for personality representation. The use of these models means you could enter in a real world person's scores from those models, and have NPCs behave similarly to them. The personality and emotional models are represented with vectors and matrices with weighting to represent base emotional stimulation, meaning you can resolve the states really fast with multiplications.
                
                <br><br>I believe this technology when matured could lead to a whole new era of NPC interactions, where NPCs can determine an emotional state dynamically based on emergent gameplay scenarios, rather than from prescripted triggers. This work earned me a 100% grade on my final dissertation, and enabled me to win a TIGA Graduate of the Year award in 2022.

                Developed as part of the AI module I took in my final year at university, I implemented a neural network system ontop of a provided freely available Flappy Bird implementation to have an AI learn how to play the game effectively. Required score for a good grade was 400, implementation reached a score of over 40,000. AI is achieved with genetic algorithm approach, with weights acting as the genome, using one hidden layer and the inputs being positional info relative to pipes, and the output being whether to flap or not. Weights, inputs and outputs are visualized in the UI. I also found that by modifying the game to allow for multiple parallel birds, I could speed up training massively.

                A simple DirectX 11 scene made during my time at university. It features basic rendering, mesh loading, dynamic lighting (point lights), and dynamic colouration of terrain (sand, grass, rock, snow) based on height using a pixel shader. The subject of the scene is a player-controllable boat with several possible camera angles. The water uses a vertex shader to move the vertices up and down, as well as UV offsetting with a sine wave, to try to simulate basic motion.
