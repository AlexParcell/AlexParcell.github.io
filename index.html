            <p class="text-center">
                I developed this project for my Game Engines Creation module during my first year of university,
                programming it in C++ using the SDL library. The end result is a clone of both the original arcade Mario
                Bros
                game, and the original Super Mario Bros for the NES, combined into one game. I earned a grade of 97% on
                the assignment this project was developed for.

                        <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">What went well?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both games were implemented successfully and strongly resembled the source material</li>
                            <li>Making the level editor, main menu and high score tables taught me a lot about
                                developing UI components from scratch</li>
                            <li>My level editor was robust enough to enable me to accurately recreate the levels from
                                the source material</li>
                            <li>Through developing this project I was able to attain a deep understanding of how to use
                                the SDL library</li>
                            <li>In developing the engine for this project I was able to build on my knowledge of OOP to
                                organize my functionality in a much more clean fashion</li>
                            <li>My knowledge of file I/O was boosted significantly in implementing saving and loading
                                for high scores and levels</li>
                            <li>My system for managing and switching between levels ended up working really well</li>
                            <li>Multiple player characters for two player was easy to implement because of good design</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">How could I improve it?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My collision blocking had minor unexpected behaviour in a few edge cases</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>With more time, I would have researched a more robust method of collision blocking
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The level editor could have been more user-friendly</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>More hotkeys could have boosted workflow efficiency</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>My implementation for UI buttons could have been improved</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The current system is not very modular and adding new buttons can be a very
                                    complicated task</li>
                                <li>Performing AABB checks on every button onscreen to see if it collides with the mouse
                                    every frame is computationally expensive</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>I could have added more features to make the recreation more accurate</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This include enemies such as goombas, and powerups such as stars, mushrooms and fire
                                    flowers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>I could have added more possible characters for text</li>
