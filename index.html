                I developed this project for my Game Engines Creation module during my first year of university,
                programming it in C++ using the SDL library. The end result is a clone of both the original arcade Mario
                Bros
                game, and the original Super Mario Bros for the NES, combined into one game. I earned a grade of 97% on
                the assignment this project was developed for.

                                <li>Both games were implemented successfully and strongly resembled the source material

                                <li>Making the level editor, main menu and high score tables taught me a lot about
                                    developing UI components from scratch</li>
                                <li>My level editor was robust enough to enable me to accurately recreate the levels
                                    from
                                    the source material</li>
                                <li>Through developing this project I was able to attain a deep understanding of how to
                                    use
                                    the SDL library</li>
                                <li>In developing the engine for this project I was able to build on my knowledge of OOP
                                    to
                                    organize my functionality in a much more clean fashion</li>
                                <li>My knowledge of file I/O was boosted significantly in implementing saving and
                                    loading
                                    for high scores and levels</li>
                                <li>My system for managing and switching between levels ended up working really well
                                </li>
                                <li>Multiple player characters for two player was easy to implement because of good
                                    design
                                </li>

                                <li>My collision blocking had minor unexpected behaviour in a few edge cases</li>

                                    <li>With more time, I would have researched a more robust method of collision

                                <li>My implementation for UI buttons could have been improved</li>

                                    <li>The current system is not very modular and adding new buttons can be a very
                                        complicated task</li>
                                    <li>Performing AABB checks on every button onscreen to see if it collides with the

                                        every frame is computationally expensive</li>

                                <li>I could have added more features to make the recreation more accurate</li>

                This is a work in progress application I am developing in DirectX 11 for my Further Games & Graphics

                working on this project for the last 2 months and hope to

                                <li>The skybox needs a better texture (currently placeholder), and the shape needs to be
                                    changed from a cube to a sphere</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Because the cube I am using is not intended to have inverted normals there is a
                                        weird black mark in the upper and lower portions of the shape</li>

                                <li>The camera should use interpolation to make movement less jarring</li>
                                <li>I need to implement the first person camera that follows objects and locks to their
                                    position and moves around them</li>
                                <li>The camera rotation gets buggy when looking straight up or straight down, so I need
                                    to
                                    correct that.</li>

            <p class="text-center">
                Tilewar was a project I developed at college during my studies in game design for a specialist project,
                when I specialized in engine development and programming. It is a turn based strategy game made in UE4
                primarily with the C++ API it provides, and features a custom implementation of the A* pathfinding
                algorithm.

                <ul>
                    <li>A custom tile grid system</li>
                    <li>A custom implementation of A* that is compatible with my tile system</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Makes use of UE4's binary heap data structure</li>
                        <li>Uses euclidean distance and tiebreaker heuristics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Multiple levels</li>
                    <li>Basic graphics settings</li>
                    <li>AI that reacts to conditions in the game (defensive when hurt, otherwise on the offensive
                        against
                        the player)</li>
                    <li>Multiple player characters that the player can switch between and control if they have usable
                        movement points in the turn</li>
                    <li>Win and lose conditions based on if the player kills all the enemies or the enemies kill all
                        player
                        characters</li>

                                <li>In developing this project I learned how to use C++ with Unreal Engine 4 and
                                    developed
                                    my skills in working with existing complex codebases</li>
                                <li>I successfully taught myself the A* pathfinding algorithm and managed to implement
                                    it
                                    into UE4 whilst adapting to and working with the constraints and pre-existing
                                    functionality of the engine</li>
                                <li>I managed to get the AI working well and in a way that feels challenging and
                                    interesting
                                    to play against</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>There are some minor bugs with turn order that could be fixed if I had more time to
                                    work
                                    on the project</li>
                                <li>Visuals could do with some work</li>
                                <li>The game would perhaps be more interesting if instead of using a tile based system
                                    it
                                    instead was more freeform with some terrain that takes longer to traverse than other
                                    terrain</li>
                                <li>My calculations that work out damage dealt by attacks that factor in the attack and
                                    defense of both the attacker and defender could have been more thought out</li>
