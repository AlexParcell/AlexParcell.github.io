                    <p class="text-center">
                        I am an experienced game developer who has been developing games for the past 4 years. My
                        journey in game development started when I was 15 as I started studying Computer Game Design at
                        college, and I have since moved on and started studying Computer Game Programming at
                        Staffordshire University.

                I developed this project for my Game Engines Creation module during my first year of university,
                programming it in C++ using the SDL library. The end result is a clone of both the original arcade Mario
                Bros
                game, and the original Super Mario Bros for the NES, combined into one game. I earned a grade of 97% on
                the assignment this project was developed for.

                            <li>Making the level editor, main menu and high score tables taught me a lot about
                                developing UI components from scratch</li>
                            <li>My level editor was robust enough to enable me to accurately recreate the levels from
                                the source material</li>
                            <li>Through developing this project I was able to attain a deep understanding of how to use

                                <li>The current system is not very modular and adding new buttons can be a very
                                    complicated task</li>
                                <li>Performing AABB checks on every button onscreen to see if it collides with the mouse
                                    every frame is computationally expensive</li>
