                    <p class="text-center">
                        I am an experienced game developer who has been developing games for the past 4 years. My
                        journey in game development started when I was 15 as I started studying Computer Game Design at
                        college, and I have since moved on and started studying Computer Game Programming at
                        Staffordshire University.

            <p class="text-center">
                I developed this project for my Game Engines Creation module during my first year of university,
                programming it in C++ using the SDL library. The end result is a clone of the original arcade Mario Bros
                game, and a clone of the original Super Mario Bros for the NES, all implemented into one game. Features
                include one and two-player modes for both games, a functional level editor that works for both games
                simultaeniously, high scores for both games,and functional user interface components that are used in
                the main menu and level editor. Game-related features include working collision, AI, animation, sound,
                and gameplay functionality such as death, score, victory conditions (for Super Mario Bros) and
                collectibles (coins). I earned an overall grade of 97% for this assignment.
