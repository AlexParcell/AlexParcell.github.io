            <p class="text-center">
                Made in Unreal Engine 4 using blueprint visual scripting in six weeks, Ramen Rush is a singleplayer
                cooking game in which the player has to make ramen for hungry customers before time runs out, hoping to
                make enough money to make rent for that day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                I made this game for my final project during my third year
                of college and earned a Distinction grade for it. My role on this project oriented around designing and
                programming the game, but I collaborated with a
                professional sound designer to implement the sound effects and music.

                <ul>
                    <li>Fully functioning main menu with basic graphics/gameplay/audio settings, helpful information on
                        gameplay, credits, and a play button </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Based on whether there is saved data or not from previous gameplay sessions, the play button
                            will either let the player carry on where they left off or start a new game</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Autosave functionality that keeps track of where the player is in terms of progress that can be
                        loaded in when the game starts</li>
                    <li>A fully functional tutorial for new players when they start a new game</li>
                    <li>Spline-based movement for customers</li>
                    <li>Custom built Z-indexing that factors in position on Y axis to determine position on Z axis</li>
                    <li>Fully implemented sound effects provided custom-made by collaborating with a professional sound
                        designer</li>
                    <li>Pixel art developed by myself</li>
                    <li>Win and lose conditions based on whether earnings are sufficient or not, that then enables
                        progression if sufficient</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Problems Solved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I needed a way to get customers to walk in and out of the ramen restaurant, but instead of using
                        a computationally expensive pathfinding solution I instead just had them follow a spline
                        forwards when they enter, and then backwards when they leave</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To add variation, there are about a dozen different potential splines in the level, and all
                            ones not currently in use are factored into a random selection that the customer makes when
                            they spawn</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>During playtesting, I noted that nobody really understood how to play the game. I first added a
                        help section in the main menu and even a little digital booklet that showed at the start of the
                        first level, but nobody was taking the time to read it. So, I created an interactive tutorial
                        that ensured the player would understand how to make ramen. Playtesting showed that this
                        solution worked.</li>
                    <li>Due to the fact that I had only 6 weeks to develop this game, I scoped this game to be as
                        simplistic but fulfilling as I could.</li>
                    <li>I was using Unreal Engine 4, an inherently 3D engine, and noted that creating the illusion of
                        depth in a 2D space was really difficult to achieve. I reverse engineered other games that do
                        the same effect and realized that they had a system where the highest on the Y axis an entity
                        was, the lower it's Z index would be. I implemented a system to Z index using this method during
                        runtime.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is why if the player stands behind a counter, they will render behind it, but if they
                            stand infront of it, they will render ontop of it.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <li>Considering time constraints, I was able to make a well recieved game that attracted
                                    a lot of attention from visitors at the end of year game show.</li>
                                <li>I managed to successfully collaborate with a professional game developer for the
                                    first time in developing this project.</li>
                                <li>The game implementation was extremely smooth, and I feel like I demonstrated a deep
                                    knowledge of blueprint visual scripting in making the game.</li>
                                <li>The implemented tutorial fulfilled the design goal of teaching new players how to
                                    play successfully.</li>
                                <li>The targetted gameplay aesthetics were delivered as predicted in design.</li>

                                <li>With more time I could have potentially added a gameplay mode that never ends with a
                                    high score system, to improve replayability</li>

            <p class="text-center">
                Synthfighter is a Star Fox inspired endless runner in which the player is tasked with shooting targets
                to open gates so they can continue to evade the aliens that are chasing them. The goal is to get the
                highest score possible.

                I made this game alongside a 3D modeller and sound designer for our final project during my second year
                at college. We completed the project in around 12 weeks and earned grade Distinction for our work. My
                role in the team was that of team leader, technical designer and UI/UX designer.

                <ul>
                    <li>Functional menus including a main menu, pause menu and death menu</li>
                    <li>A high score system that motivates the player to aim to live for the longest time they can</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because this is an endless runner, this feature was absolutely essential</li>
                        <li>I also implemented a little system to randomly generate a name if the player cannot think of
                            one</li>
                        <li>The player can choose to optionally submit a score after they die during gameplay</li>
                        <li>High scores save to file and can be reloaded in during future plays</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This was implemented as a response to feedback late in development, as the HUD was taking
                            the player's eye away from the ship</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Ship movement that accurately simulates how a ship tilts and turns during flight</li>

                        <li>The player can also barrel roll, as a homage to Star Fox.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Fully implemented sound and models sourced internally in our development team.</li>
                    <li>Full gamepad support.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Problems Solved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To accomodate endless runner gameplay, I implemented a system where there is a baseclass level
                        segment, and just before gates are opened, a new segment is loaded in.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are subclasses to the level segments, each unique with unique configurations of
                            targets and collectibles, any designer working on the project can simply make a class that
                            inherits from the baseclass and it will be included.</li>
                        <li>Because theoretically if the game went on forever the game would slow down as more and more
                            instances of level segments come in, level segments are destroyed when they have been
                            passed.</li>
                        <li>A level segment subclass is randomly chosen and spawned in just before the gate opens during
                            runtime, like a very rudimentary form of procedural generation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Players were complaining that the HUD was breaking immersion, so I implemented a diagetic HUD
                        that seemed to have solved the issue in later playtesting sessions.</li>

                                <li>Sound and art were developed to fit the needs of the project and I managed to
                                    implement them appropriately with the aid of my team.</li>
                                <li>The ship felt good to control.</li>
                                <li>We managed to successfully explore the endless runner aspect of the game, and the
                                    game theoretically could run indefinitely for the most part.</li>

                                    <li>Maybe eventually things like the score would overflow, but that would take an
                                        exceptionally long time.</li>

                                <li>The game could use more variation, perhaps in terms of the direction the player
                                    moves in changing, forked paths where they must choose which way to go.</li>

                                <li>The presence of the enemies chasing you is not very well communicated to the player

                                    <li>Maybe if I had a little UI panel that showed a rear view mirror type view of how
                                        close they are, that would have conveyed more threat.</li>

                                <li>There is a popup that asks about a Substance plugin when the executable is ran, even
                                    though the Substance UE4 plugin is not used in the game. I should have taken some

            <p class="text-center">
                Cyber Samurai Insurgency is a 2D cyberpunk platformer where you play as a digital samurai exploring the
                databases of a corrupt Orwellian world government, the goal being to progress to the end of the level.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                I developed this game in 12 weeks for my final project in my first year of college and earned a
                Distinction for it.

                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A main menu, pause menu, death menu and level complete menu</li>
                    <li>Implemented sound, music, art and animation provided by me</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perhaps not of the highest quality, my focus was ultimately on programming.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Secret terminals that give insight into the lore of the world</li>
                    <li>Static enemies that must be avoided and attacked to destroy</li>
                    <li>Death and health mechanics that cause the player to die if they fall off the level or get hit by
                        enemies too many times</li>
                    <li>A camera that follows the player across the screen</li>
                    <li>Multiple levels</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Problems Solved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting the camera to follow the player without breaking the bounds of the level was a tricky
                        challenge for me, as it was something I had never made before.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some levels have the camera locked on the vertical axis, but others do not, so I had to
                            account for that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                            <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">What went well?</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I think the game fit the theme relatively well.</li>
                                <li>Overall, the game works with no major bugs or technical issues.</li>
                                <li>The level design is varied and contains interesting features in the form of the secrets.</li>
                                <li>The user interface looks good in the main menu.</li>
                                <li>I produced a game to completion for the first time in making this game, and learned a lot about the process of developing games in doing so.</li>

                            <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">How could I improve it?</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The movement is quite floaty and could use some work.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Varying animations for jumping, falling, being hit would have improved the feel of movement.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>The game lacks variation in sound effects, and sound effects are quite poor quality and repetitive.</li>
                                <li>The music is also quite repetitive.</li>
                                <li>A system where levels can only be accessed if the preceding level is beaten would have been better.</li>
                                <li>Enemies would have been way more engaging to fight if they moved around and took more than one hit to kill.</li>
                            </ul>
